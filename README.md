# Right-Click-Magic
Right Click = Everything

We are using right click everyday in ourlives. It helps us make our lives better and **faster**. Right click has some options available but these option have a limit.  
We can add more capabilities to our right click by using a free tool called EMC [Easy Context Menu](https://www.sordum.org/7615/easy-context-menu-v1-6/).  
It is developed by the **Sordum Team** and let us add some predefined **and not only** options to our right click. Basically we can add everything there.  
Let's see some of its powers in the following sections. 

## Capabilities

Let's see the main interface first.

As we can see there are some predefined features available like the "Empty Recycle Bin" or the "Delete Temporary Files" options.    

To add our custom actions we have to click the "List Editor" button.

Now we can edit the actions available in the right click menu.

Let's try to add a custom action in a new right click option. First we will create a new sub menu by clicking the "Add Sub Menu" button. Let's name it "This is a new Group"

After that we have to add a new action in this sub menu. To do this just click "Add New" and navigate to the desired location for adding the action. After choosing the wanted file click "Save Changes" to apply the addition.
